# Implementing_Predictive_Processing
Code to reproduce experiments described in the Implementing Predictive Processing Report. Code is still fairly disorganised and representative of the experimental progress. Contains results for the static, dynamical, and full construct predictive coding models as well as the thermostat and cartpole active inference agents.
